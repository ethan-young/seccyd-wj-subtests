The names of each folder are intended to be self-explanatory. There are
six top-level folders to organize the inputs and outputs of this
project:

1.  [`codebooks/`](codebooks/README.md): lists of variable names,
    labels, and value labels (where applicable).
2.  `data/`: data, stored as an `.Rdata` file and `.csv` files.
3.  `manuscript/`: a manuscript written in R markdown for submission to
    a journal.
4.  [`preregistration/`](preregistration/README.md): a document based on
    (Akker et al. 2021) that details my plans for this project.
5.  `scripts/`: R-scripts that read, analyze, and produce all outputs.
6.  `supplement/`: a supplemental text with additional information and
    materials.
