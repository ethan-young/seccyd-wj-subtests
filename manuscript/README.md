Developmental science commonly asserts that adversity-exposure during
development reduces cognitive performance—a claim founded on decades of
empirical findings (Duncan et al., 2017; Farah et al., 2006; Fraley et
al., 2013; Hackman et al., 2010; McLaughlin et al., 2019; Raby et al.,
2015). In recent years, however, adaptation-based frameworks, rooted in
the idea that adversity might enhance certain abilities, have
complemented this work—and it is gaining traction (Ellis et al., 2017;
Ellis et al., 2020; Frankenhuis, Young, et al., 2020; Frankenhuis & de
Weerth, 2013; Frankenhuis & Nettle, 2020). Since its inception, the goal
of adaptation-based frameworks has been to inspire a more well-rounded
view of adversity and its influence on abilities—one that incorporates
both the struggles and strengths of people from disadvantaged
backgrounds (Frankenhuis & de Weerth, 2013). As it develops further, the
core task of adaptation-based research is to “uncover a high-resolution
map of specific cognitive abilities that are enhanced as a result of
growing up under high-adversity conditions” (Ellis et al., 2017, p.
562). To uncover this map, researchers have used confirmatory study
designs, which have gleaned useful insights. Yet, to cultivate growth in
an emerging research program—where there is little known and much to
learn—we must not dig too deep, too fast. Without complimentary
approaches, exclusive use of confirmatory designs can create tunnel
vision and miss new insights (McIntosh, 2017; Roisman, 2021; Rozin,
2001; Scheel et al., 2021).

In this paper, we use a complimentary approach to confirmatory research:
principled exploration. To guide our exploration, we build on two basic
insights from adaptation-based research: 1) enhanced performance
manifests within individuals and 2) reduced and enhanced performance can
co-occur. The first insight implies we need designs and models that can
tease apart both within- and between-person performance differences. The
second suggests that, to map out more of the adversity-ability
landscape, we must examine multiple abilities measured within the same
person. Doing so will allow us to capture performance profiles that
comprise three conceptual data patterns: reduced, intact, and enhanced
performance. Past research has focused on reduced and enhanced
performance on tests of single abilities. However, we know little about
intact abilities, or cases where performance is unrelated to adversity
exposure. Thus, our goal is to document adversity-shaped cognitive
profiles that include reduced, ‘intact’ abilities, and enhanced test
performance patterns.

# **Essential Features and Empirical Insights from Adaptation-based Frameworks**

Adaptation-based research has two essential features. First, it assumes
development shapes the individual, and their abilities, to fit the local
environment (Frankenhuis, Young, et al., 2020). Second, because
environments differ in the challenges they pose (resource-scarcity
versus violence exposure), development shapes abilities according to
specific challenges. Thus, one’s abilities are thought to match the
challenges of one’s lived experience. These features are useful
guideposts for confirmatory hypothesis generation. Using them as
building blocks, it is easy to construct an intuitive bridge between an
ability and an environmental challenge. For example, a researcher might
identify a specific challenge posed by a dimension of adversity (e.g.,
threats to safety in high-crime neighborhoods) and an ability needed to
meet the challenge (e.g., enhanced threat detection).

This approach is appealing because it forces researchers to be specific
and logically tie together challenges and abilities. It has also been
successful in discovering a handful of interesting adversity-enhanced
abilities, especially in harsh and unpredictable environments. For
example, past work has proposed that constantly changing environments
(i.e., unpredictable environments) might shape the ability to track and
respond to changing information. Using this logic, research build an
intuitive bridge between changing environments and two
abilities–attention-shifting and working memory updating—and some
empirical data are consistent with this logic (Fields et al., 2021;
Mittal et al., 2015; Nweze et al., 2021; Young et al., 2018). However,
there are two limitations to this approach. First, previous studies are
difficult to compare because they use different measures and designs.
Second, the logic behind confirmatory hypotheses is easily flipped. For
example, exposure to unpredictable environments is thought to reduce
inhibition, or the ability to resist distractions. If opportunities are
fleeting and threats are unpredictable, inhibition is costly because
focusing on long-term goals might cause one to miss opportunities or
fail to detect a threat. But we can also assert the exact opposite. For
example, inhibition might be enhanced by unpredictable environments
because attending to every possible opportunity or threat will derail
most goal-directed actions. This might be especially true when
unpredictable environments are chaotic and only a small fraction of
information is useful.

Adaptation-based research has also focused on testing content, or the
notion that performance should improve when the testing content matches
the lived experience of people exposed to adversity. For example,
studies have examined relational memory, attention shifting, and working
memory task performance using more ecologically relevant testing content
(e.g., social dominance, real-world, and socioemotional stimuli)
compared to neutral or abstract content. In some cases, ecologically
relevant content appeared to equalize performance for people exposed to
adversity, but this depends on the specific adversity measure and task
(Frankenhuis, de Vries, et al., 2020; Rifkin-Graboi et al., 2021; Young
et al., 2022). Yet, in other studies, conditions thought to be
well-matched to the lived experience of those exposed to adversity
actually lower performance. For example, youth from poverty tended to
score lower on math items about social relations, money, and food—items
thought to be particularly relevant to lived experience—compared to
other math items (Duquennois, 2022; Muskens, 2019).

In light of various caveats, this body of work has generated at least
two empirical insights. First, although it is possible for adversity to
enhance performance between individuals (e.g., low versus high adversity
exposure), empirical findings suggest effects mostly occur within
individuals (Fields et al., 2021; Frankenhuis, de Vries, et al., 2020;
Young et al., 2022). Second, associations between specific types of
adversity and enhanced performance appears to be highly context
specific—enhancements depend on testing content, context, and ability
type (Fields et al., 2021; Frankenhuis, de Vries, et al., 2020; Mittal
et al., 2015; Nweze et al., 2021; Young et al., 2018; Young et al.,
2022). Yet, adaptation-based studies have looked for abilities in an
isolated and piecemeal fashion, in part, because confirmatory designs
tend to narrow a study’s scope. This means we know little about enhanced
abilities compared with the broad landscape of ability measures.

# **Motivating Principled Exploration**

We believe that adaptation-based frameworks can provide useful
guideposts. However, one should use shovels, not scalpels, when breaking
new ground. Emerging research programs have yet to lay basic groundwork
for testing theories, such as auxiliary assumptions or boundary
conditions (Scheel et al., 2021). Our aim is to complement
adaptation-based, confirmatory research with principled exploration
(Flournoy et al., 2020; Rozin, 2001). We see two benefits of this
approach. The first is to re-examine established patterns with a new
lens. For example, both deficit- and adaptation-based perspectives
assume that adversity should reduce performance on standard assessments
of cognitive ability (Ellis et al., 2020; Frankenhuis, Young, et al.,
2020; Hackman et al., 2010; McLaughlin et al., 2019; Ursache & Noble,
2016). Yet, these tests are often comprised of many different subtests,
and may show unique patterns that diverge from widely used composite
scores. The second is to feed theory with useful description. One reason
why we know little about broad sets of abilities is that adaptive logic
is yet to be developed for some abilities. However, the lack of such
logic this does not imply the presence or absence of a functional link.
A complementary approach is to explore, describe, and follow up
associations between adversity and abilities to aid theory development.
Therefore, we return to the map of cognitive abilities that might be
shaped by adversity and ask “what territory needs exploration and which
areas may need re-mapping?”

To carefully examine and interpret data in a principled exploration, it
is helpful to develop inferential criteria. For example, rather than
using adaptive-logic to predict which abilities are enhanced or reduced,
we can ask what criteria are needed for evaluating and interpreting
different data patterns? In addition, research typically focuses on
reduced versus enhanced test performance, but some abilities might
remain ‘intact’ (unaffected) by exposure to adversity (Frankenhuis,
Young, et al., 2020). We know little about the intact abilities of
people exposed to adversity. We also know little about the drivers of
reduced performance on broad and generic measures of ability and
achievement. For example, deficit approaches have collapsed many
abilities into composites and find that adversity exposure reduces
performance (Fraley et al., 2013; Raby et al., 2015). However, one
possibility is that a smaller set of specific abilities are driving
effects. In total, there is still much to learn about how adversity
shapes cognitive abilities. Principled exploration can complement
confirmatory research in drawing this map, especially in the early
stages of a new field.

# The Current Study

We conduct a principled exploration of how adversity relates to
performance on a widely-used cognitive achievement battery using
longitudinal, prospective data from the Study of Early Childcare and
Youth Development (SECCYD). Drawing on the general insights of
adaptation-based research, we employ a within-person performance design
to explore performance across 10 abilities. This design allows us to
assess how exposure to each measure of adversity is associated with
relative performance differences across many abilities (see Figure 1).
In other words, we can compare specific abilities (e.g., short-term
memory performance) to overall performance (within-person average
performance on all tests) to get a clear picture of how enhanced and
reduced performance manifest in parallel within an individual.

We focus on adversity measures that tap two constructs: environmental
harshness and unpredictability. We focus on these constructs because
they feature often in adaptation-based research on cognitive abilities
(Ellis et al., 2017; Ellis et al., 2020; Fields et al., 2021;
Frankenhuis, Young, et al., 2020; Mittal et al., 2015; Young et al.,
2018; Young et al., 2022). We use both previously-used and unexplored
measures for both. Previous measures include family transitions
(paternal, residential, and occupational changes) and income-to-needs
(mean and variability). Unexplored measures include neighborhood
disadvantage (mean and variability). We leverage data from the 1990
Census about the broader ecological context, which has been used to
measure the neighborhood context in the SECCYD previously (Bleil,
Spieker, et al., 2021; Bleil, Appelhans, et al., 2021).

We outline two sets of criteria for evaluating results. First, our
expectations change according to the conceptual framework. For example,
from a traditional deficit perspective, we should expect negative
overall effects of adversity. Performance on subtests should closely
match the overall effect. In contrast, from an adaptation-based
perspective, we expect an overall negative effect but performance on
some subtests is either less reduced, intact, or even enhanced.

Our second set of criteria are statistical. Our modeling strategy allows
us to quantify performance as a function of adversity in two ways.
First, we can test whether the effect of adversity on each subtest is
different from zero using a simple slopes test. A positive and negative
effect suggests enhanced and reduced performance, respectively. Second,
we compare subset performance (simple slope) against overall performance
(main effect of adversity across all tests), which is measured by the
interaction between subtest category and adversity. This interaction
term indicates whether performance is significantly more negative, less
negative, or even positive compared to overall performance. For both
types of effects, we can determine if they are practically equivalent to
either zero (simple effect) or overall performance (main effect).
Subtest performance is intact when the effect of adversity on a subtest
is practically equivalent to zero. Using these criteria, we position
ourselves to identify the drivers of reduced overall cognitive
performance, map out sets of ‘intact’ cognitive abilities, and discover
(possible) enhancements.

B) is the main effect of a subtest, which reflects the average performance on a subtest. C) is the simple effect (slope) of adversity for a particular subtest. D) is the interaction effect that measures the difference between A and C. A significant simple effect means the C ≠ 0 and a significant interaction means A ≠ C. Put differently, when C is significant, it means that adversity is associated with performance on a subtest. When D is significant, it means that the assocaition between adversity and a subtest (C) is different than the association between adversity and the overall effect (A)." />

# Method

## Participants

Families were initially recruited for the NICHD SECCYD in 1991. A total
of 1364 families met all the prescreening criteria, namely that mothers:
(a) were age 18 or older, (b) did not plan to move, (c) had a newborn
without any known disabilities (and could leave the hospital within one
week), (d) had no history of substance abuse, (e) could speak English,
and (f) lived within 1 hour driving distance from the research lab and
were in a relatively safe neighborhood. More information about
recruitment and selection procedures is available from the study
\[Network (2005); see
https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/series/00233\]. The current
analyses included participants with non-missing data on most predictors
and outcome variables through age 15 (N = 1156).

## Measures

### **Cognitive Ability Test Battery**

We used the Woodcock-Johnson (WJ) Cognitive and Achievement standardized
test battery to examine performance across 10 subtests (Woodcock et al.,
1990; Woodcock, 1990). The SECCYD administered the WJ five times over
the 54 month, 1<sup>st</sup> grade, 3<sup>rd</sup> grade, 5<sup>th</sup>
grade, and 15-year assessments.

There are two WJ test batteries, the cognitive and achievement tests.
The WJ cognitive test includes the Memory for Names, Memory for
Sentences, Verbal Analogies, Incomplete Words, and Picture Vocabulary
subtests (see below for descriptions). The WJ achievement battery
includes Letter-Word Identification, Passage Completion, Calculations,
Applied Problems, and Word Attack subtests (see below for descriptions).

For all tests, we analyzed standard scores, which are equivalent to IQ
scores (e.g., *M* = 100, *SD* = 15). Using standard scores for subtests
puts all tests on the same scale to facilitate comparison (see Figure
2). For each subtest, we averaged standard scores over time to create
one score per subtest, per participant. However, the specific set of
subtests administered at each assessment varied (see Figure 2). For
example, the Verbal Analogies test was measured at grade three and age
15 whereas Passage completion was measured at grades 3, 5, and age 15
(see Table 1). Thus, to create overall scores for each subtest, we
averaged over all time points available for each subtest (see
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-agg-dvs> for code).

![***Figure 2.*** WJ subtest standard scores across assessments.

**Picture Vocabulary.** This subtest measures verbal comprehension and
crystallized knowledge. The test contains 58 items requiring
participants to view and name familiar and unfamiliar objects. The test
was administered five times at 54 months, grades 1, 3, 5, and at 15
years. Higher scores indicate more verbal comprehension and more
crystallized knowledge.

**Verbal Analogies.** This subtest measures the ability to reason about
analogies between relatively simple words. Although the words remain
simple, relations between words increase in complexity of over the test
items. The test contains 35 items and was assessed twice at grades 3 and
5. Higher scores indicate more reasoning and more verbal/crystallized
knowledge.

**Passage Comprehension.** This subtest test measures the ability to
read a short passage and name an appropriate key word that is missing.
The test contains 43 items and was administered three times at grades 3,
5, and at age 15. Higher scores indicate more vocabulary, comprehension,
and reading skill.

**Applied Problems.** This subtest contains a set of practical math
problems. Participants must read and identify a strategy for solving the
problem and execute simple arithmetic calculations. The test contains 60
items and was administered at the 54-month, 1<sup>st</sup>,
3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade, and 15-year assessments. Higher
scores indicate more practical math and problem-solving skill.

**Calculations.** This subtest required participants to solve
traditional math problems containing addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and different combinations of each. The test
also includes some geometry and trigonometry problems. Some items
require logarithmic operations and calculus. The test contains 58 items
and was administered at the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade
assessments. Higher scores indicate more mathematical/quantitative
skill.

**Memory for Names.** This subtest is an auditory-visual association
test. It requires participants to learn a set of ‘space creatures’ and
their names. After learning a set of creature-name pairs, participants
must identify which in a set of nine creatures were just introduced and
those previously in past sets. The test difficulty is controlled by
(decreasing) increasing the create-name pairs presented in each set. The
test contains 72 items and was administered at the 1<sup>st</sup> and
3<sup>rd</sup> grade assessments. Higher scores indicate more
visual-auditory association and long-term memory skill.

**Incomplete Words.** This subtest measures the ability to listen to
words containing missing phonemes and complete the word. The test
contains 40 items and was administered at the 54 month and
1<sup>st</sup> grade assessments. Higher scores indicate more auditory
processing skill.

**Memory for Sentences.** This subtest measures the ability to listen to
and remember words, phrases, and sentences. The words, phrases, and
sentences are played on an audio tape and participants must recall as
many as possible. The test contains 32 items and was administered at the
54-month, 1<sup>st</sup> grade, and 3<sup>rd</sup> grade assessments.
Higher scores indicate more short-term memory skill.

**Letter-word Identification.** This subtest measures reading and
pronunciation ability. Participants must initially read letters and then
words, which gradually increase in difficulty. The test contains 57
items and was administered at the 54-month, 1<sup>st</sup>,
3<sup>rd</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> grade assessments. Higher scores
indicate more verbal knowledge.

**Word Attack.** This subtest measures the ability to pronounce
unfamiliar words. Participants must read aloud phonetically logical but
nonsense or infrequent words. It contains 30 items and was administered
at the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> grade assessments. Higher
scores indicate more auditory processing and linguistic structural
analysis knowledge and skill.

### Indicators of Harshness

We measured environmental harshness in two ways. First, following
previous studies using data from the SECCYD, we used income-to-needs
ratio scores from 1, 6, 15, 24, 36, and 54-month assessments (Belsky et
al., 2012; Hartman et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Sung et al., 2016;
Zhang et al., 2022). We calculated a simple average of all
income-to-needs scores across assessments to create an overall
income-to-needs score (see <https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-agg-income>
for code).

Second, we leveraged data from the 1990 Census about the broader
economic and ecological context in a similar way to previous analyses of
neighborhood-level economic conditions in the SECCYD (Bleil, Spieker, et
al., 2021; Bleil, Appelhans, et al., 2021). Specifically, addresses were
tracked for each participant over time. Each family address start and
stop dates were recorded, geocoded, and linked to the 1990 decennial
Census blocks. These blocks are the smallest Census-tracked geographical
unit. For each Census block, sociodemographic data were extracted from
the Census databases to measure neighborhood-level economic conditions
for each participant. We extracted 5 variables: 1) percent of people
living under the poverty line, 2) median household income, 3) Gini
coefficients of income inequality based on income frequency data, 4)
percent of unemployed individuals over 16 in the workforce, and the
percent of occupied houses that were being rented. These neighborhood
variables were standardized and then averaged to create a neighborhood
poverty score for each home a participant lived in. Next, we averaged
these neighborhood scores over time (up until the 54-month assessment).
Thus, if a participant lived in two homes between birth and the 54-month
assessment, neighborhood-level variables would be standardized and
averaged within the first and second Census block, and then averaged
between them. These scores served as neighborhood-level socioeconomic
poverty scores where higher scores indicate higher rates of poverty,
income-inequality, unemployment, and lower education (see
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-processing-census> for processing and
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-agg-census> for aggregation).

### **Indicators of Unpredictability**

Environmental unpredictability is notoriously hard to define and measure
(Young et al., 2020). Nonetheless, studies leveraging data from the
SECCYD have used two approaches. The first is track and count family
transitions, including changes in paternal figures living in the home,
parental job transitions, and residential changes (Belsky et al., 2012;
Hartman et al., 2018). The second approach is to quantify variability in
repeated measures of harshness indicators (e.g., computing variance in
income-to-needs across time). For example, Li and colleagues (2018) fit
a linear model to each participants’ income-to-needs scores over time.
Then, they computed the residual variance around participant-level
linear trends in income-to-needs to create an income variability score.
In the current study, we compute unpredictability scores using both
approaches and extend the Li and colleagues (2018) approach to the
neighborhood-level Census block data.

To calculate a family transitions, we computed the number of paternal
figure changes (father figures moving in and out of the home), mother
and father (figure) job changes, and residential changes across 17
assessments from 1 to 54 months (Belsky et al., 2012; Hartman et al.,
2018). After computing scores across time, we standardized each variable
and averaged them together to compute an overall family transitions
variable (see <https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-agg-transitions> for code).

We calculated both familial and neighborhood-level economic variability.
For, income-to-needs scores, we computed a simple standard deviation of
all income-to-needs scores for each participant from the 1, 6, 15, 24,
36, and 54-month assessments (see
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-agg-income> for code). For
neighborhood-level poverty variability, we computed the standard
deviation of neighborhood socioeconomic harshness scores (see Indicators
of Harshness). If participants had only lived in one Census block from 1
to 54 months, their neighborhood socioeconomic poverty variability score
was 0 (see <https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-agg-census> for code).

### **Control Variables**

We used a standard set of three control variables typically used in
analyses of SECCYD data: 1) maternal education, 2) sex assigned at birth
(1 = female), and 3) the race/ethnicity of each child coded as
White/non-Hispanic = 0, otherwise = 1.

# Results

## Preregistration, Statistical Power, and Computational Reproducibility

We preregistered this study using a template for secondary data analysis
(Akker et al., 2021). The preregistration document and its entire
version history was tracked on GitHub (see
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-prereg> for the document and
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-prereg-history> for revision history).

We also conducted a power analysis as part of our preregistration (see
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-power> for write up and see
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-power-code> for code). In short, we used
a simulation approach to conduct power analyses. Although we simulated
adversity scores, we leveraged the actual WJ test scores from SECCYD
data used in this study. Simulations showed that, with a sample size of
(N = 1156), the smallest interaction effect we can detect is $\beta$ =
-.075 (or .075) with 90% power, if error is small. When error is larger,
we can detect the same effect size with only 65% power. However, even
with larger error, we can detect a $\beta$ = -.10 (or .10) with 83%
power.

All relevant files (data processing, analysis code, manuscript etc.) for
this project are tracked on GitHub (see
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj>), including data needed to reproduce all
results (see <https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-data>). Raw data (data
provided by SECCYD) is only available via ICPSR
([https://www.icpsr.umich.edu](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/rpxlogin)).
However, documentation for the study is free to download (see
<https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/21940>), which contains
lists of raw datasets and variables. For those who have access to raw
SECCYD data, we provide a table of raw datasets and variables used in
this project (see <https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-data>).

We used R, Rstudio, and Quarto to process, analyze, and report results
(Allaire, 2022; Posit team, 2023; R Core Team, 2023). For reading raw
SECCYD data, used the haven and readxl R packages (Wickham et al., 2023;
Wickham & Bryan, 2023). For data processing, visualizations, and table
creation, we used the tidyverse, sjlabelled, ggdist, ggsci, and the
patchwork R packages (Gohel & Skintzos, 2023; Kay, 2023; Lüdecke, 2022;
Pedersen, 2022; Wickham et al., 2019; Xiao, 2023). For analyses,
including mixed models, simple slopes, and equivalence tests, we used
lme4, faux, ggeffects, marginaleffects, and the parameters R packages
(Arel-Bundock, 2023; Bates et al., 2015; DeBruine, 2023; Lüdecke, 2018;
Lüdecke et al., 2020).

## Data Analysis Strategy and Inferential Criteria

We used a mixed effects modeling approach to analyze how adversity
relates to WJ performance. For our primary analyses, we ran one model
per adversity variable. Each model contained sex assigned at birth,
race/ethnicity, and maternal education as covariates. Adversity and
covariates were standardized or recoded to center variables at 0.

To analyze and compare WJ subtest performance with overall WJ
performance, we restructured the data so that each participant was
represented by 10 rows, one for each WJ subtest score. Then, we created
a sum coded contrast variable for WJ subtests with 10 levels (one for
each subtest). This type of contrast sets the model intercept to the
grand mean (e.g., the mean of all subtest scores). To analyze the
effects of adversity on test performance, we entered adversity as a main
effect and the interaction between adversity and the contrast-coded
subtest variable.

A model with this structure will contain a main effect for each
covariate, a main effect of adversity, and an interaction term for each
subtest (i.e., 10 interaction terms). The main effect of adversity
reflects the association between adversity and overall WJ performance
(e.g., within-person average of all subtests; see Figure 1). Interaction
terms reflect the association between adversity and subtest performance
*compared to the main effect of adversity* (see Figure 1). That is, they
reflect the difference between the effect of adversity on overall
performance and simple effects of adversity on subtest performance (see
Figure 1). Whearas simple effects test whether an association between
adversity and subtest performance is differnt from zero, interaction
terms measure whether a simple effect is different from the main effect.

Using this modeling strategy, we are interested in three types of effect
sizes: 1) the main effect of each adversity measure (tested in separate
models); 2) the interaction effect between an adversity measure and
subtest; and 3) the simple effect of adversity for each subtest. We do
not have specific point or range predictions for the effect size types
above. However, we view standardized regression coefficients (i.e.,
$\beta~'s$) .10 (or higher) and -.10 (or lower) meaningful. For main
effects, coefficients outside this range indicate that overall
performance is meaningfully positive or negative across levels of
adversity. For interactions, effect sizes outside these bounds indicate
that associations between adversity and subtest performance are
meaningfully more negative or more positive than overall performance.
For simple effects, effects outside these bounds indicate that the
effect of adversity on a specific subtest is meaningfully different from
zero. We are also interested in null effects. Specifically, we use
equivalence testing to determine if a given effect is practically
equivalent to a Range of Practical Significance (ROPE). We chose a ROPE
falling between $\beta$ = -.10 and $\beta$ = .10 (Kruschke, 2018; Lakens
et al., 2018). Although we report standardized coefficients, we
converted our ROPE to the WJ standard score scale by multiplying the
standard deviation of standard WJ scores (*SD* = 15) by .1. This means
our ROPE was -1.5 to 1.5 for unstandardized coefficients.

To guide interpretation, we apply a set of inferential criteria for
categorizing data patterns. We are interested in three data patterns: 1)
enhanced performance, 2) reduced performance, and 3) intact performance.
We infer ‘enhanced performance’ when main and simple effects are
positive, statistically different from zero, and outside the ROPE. We
infer ‘reduced performance’ when main and simple effects are negative,
statistically different from zero, and outside the ROPE. We infer intact
performance when a main or simple effect (and its confidence bounds) is
practically equivalent to zero (i.e., falls inside the ROPE).

We use the same criteria for interaction terms with one difference.
Because interaction terms test the difference between main and simple
effects, they quantify relative performance patterns. For ‘enhanced
relative performance’, interaction terms must be meaningfully positive
(outside the ROPE) and statistically significant. For ‘reduced relative
performance’, an interaction term must be meaningfully negative (outside
the ROPE) and statistically significant. Interaction terms that are
practically equivalent to zero reflect simple effects that closely
resemble the main effect on overall performance. However, inferring
‘enhanced’, ‘reduced’, or ‘intact’ relative performance depends on the
size and direction of the main effect. We are particularly interested in
cases where a main effect is negative and interaction terms are
positive. This may reflect ‘enhanced relative performance’ (e.g.,
meaningful and significant positive interactions), or ‘less reduced’
performance on a particular subtest in the context of an overall reduced
pattern of performance.

## Primary Analyses

Our primary analyses examined how indicators of harshness and
unpredictability were associated with WJ overall and subtest
performance. We ran one mixed model per indicator for a total of five
primary analyses (two for harshness and three for unpredictability).

All analyses controlled for the main effects of maternal education,
race/ethnicity, and sex assigned at birth. Across all models, there were
main effects for both maternal education and race/ethnicity. Lower
maternal education and having a non-White racial/ethnic background was
associated with lower WJ overall performance. No model contained effects
for sex assigned at birth. Below we describe the effects of our primary
analysis predictors (see Supplement Table 1). Primary analysis code can
be found on GitHub (see <https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-primary>).

### Indicators of Harshness

**Family Poverty (income-to-needs mean)**. Our mixed-model analyzed the
effect of family poverty on overall compared with subtest WJ
performance. There was a main effect of family poverty such that a
higher family poverty was associated with lower overall WJ performance.
Equivalence tests show that this overall main effect was meaningfully
negative (outside the ROPE, see Figure 3a).

Interaction effects between family poverty and subtests revealed a more
nuanced landscape of associations. The association between family
poverty and performance on Passage Completion, Calculations, Verbal
Analogies, Letter-Word, Short-Term Memory, and Unfamiliar Words subtests
did not differ from the overall main effect (see Figure 3). However, the
association between family poverty and performance on the Picture
Vocabulary subtest was significantly and meaningfully more negative than
overall main effect (see Figure 3). Interestingly, the association
between family poverty and performance on the Auditory Processing,
Unfamiliar Words, and Auditory-Visual Associations subtests were
significantly more positive than the overall main effect (see Figure 3).
However, equivalence tests suggest that the family poverty and
Unfamiliar Words performance association was inside the ROPE, and thus
practically equivalent to the main effect.

Our simple effects analysis tested whether the associations between
family poverty and subtest performance was statistically different from
zero and whether they were practically equivalent to the ROPE (see
Figure 3). Analyses revealed that the association between family poverty
and each of the subtests where significantly and meaningfully negative,
except for the Auditory Processing, Unfamiliar Words, and
Auditory-Visual Associations subtests (see Figure 3). For these tests,
the association between family poverty and test performance was not
statistically different from zero and practically equivalent to the ROPE
(see Figure 3).

Based on our inferential criteria, the main effect of family poverty
suggests that higher family poverty was associated with reduced overall
performance. Simple effects also revealed mostly reduced performance on
each subtest. However, for the Picture Vocabulary subtest, the family
poverty-performance association was significantly and meaningfully more
negative than the overall pattern, suggesting performance on this test
was particularly reduced for high poverty families. Interestingly, three
subtests showed relative enhancement to the overall pattern of family
poverty: Auditory Processing, Unfamiliar Words, and Auditory-Visual
Associations subtests. Yet, only the associations between family poverty
and the Auditory Processing and Auditory Visual Associations subtest
performance were outside the ROPE. However, simple effects were not
consistent with enhancement. Instead, simple effects revealed that the
family poverty-performance associations between the Auditory Processing,
Unfamiliar Words, and Auditory-Visual Associations were inside the ROPE,
suggesting higher family poverty was associated with intact performance
on these tests.

**Neighborhood Poverty (Mean)**. Analyses revealed a main effect of
neighborhood poverty such that a living in a high poverty neighborhood
was associated with reduced overall WJ performance (see Figure 3).
Equivalence tests show that this overall main effect was outside the
ROPE.

Interaction effects between neighborhood poverty and subtest were
varied. Associations between neighborhood poverty and subtest
performance on Passage Completion, Calculations, Letter-Word, and
Short-Term Memory did not statistically differ from the overall main
effect (see Figure 3). However, neighborhood poverty and subtest
performance associations for the Picture Vocabulary, Verbal Analogies,
and Applied Problems subtests were significantly more negative than the
main effect (see Figure 3). However, equivalence tests showed that only
the association between neighborhood poverty and Verbal Analogies
subtest performance was meaningfully more negative than the main effect.
Similar to the family poverty analysis, neighborhood poverty was
associated with significantly more positive performance for the Auditory
Processing and Auditory-Visual Associations compared to the overall main
effect. Equivalence tests revealed that both associations were also
meaningfully more positive, suggesting that performance on these tests
were relatively enhanced (compared to the main effect) for participants
living in high poverty neighborhoods (see Figure 3).

Simple effects revealed that higher neighborhood poverty was associated
with statistically and meaningfully negative performance for all
subtests except for the Auditory Processing and Auditory-Visual
Associations subtests. Again, for these two subtests, performance among
those living in high poverty neighborhoods was not statistically or
meaningfully different from zero.

According to our inferential criteria, results suggest that the main
effect of neighborhood poverty is consistent with reduced overall
pattern of performance. For the Verbal Analogies subtest, high
neighborhood poverty was associated with particularly reduced
performance compared with the main effect. However, high neighborhood
poverty and performance associations for the Auditory Processing and
Auditory-Visual Associations subtests were consistent with relative
enhancement. Similar to the family poverty results, simple effects were
not consistent with enhancement and instead revealed mostly reduced
performance. For the Auditory Processing and Auditory-Visual
Associations subtests, however, simple effects suggest that performance
remained intact at higher levels of neighborhood poverty.

### Indicators of Unpredictability

**Family Transitions**. Our analysis of family transitions revealed no
main effect on overall WJ performance. The main effect also fell inside
the ROPE range, suggesting that overall performance was not associated
with exposure to more family transitions (see Figure 4).

Three interaction terms were statistically significant: Calculations
(more negative), Auditory Processing (more positive), and Audio-Visual
Associations (more positive). However, only the association between
family transitions and performance on the Calculations was meaningfully
different from the main effect (see Figure 4).

Simple effects showed that exposure to family transitions was not
associated with subtest performance, except the Calculations and Applied
Problems subtests. For Calculations, exposure to more family transitions
was associated with significantly and meaningfully lower performance.
For Applied Problems, more family transitions was associated with
meaningfully lower performance, but this difference was not
statistically different from zero (i.e., the association was not
significant but was outside the ROPE).

Our inferential criteria suggest that exposure to family transitions was
associated with intact overall WJ performance. Simple effects suggest
that performance on most subtests was also mostly intact among those
exposed to family transitions. However, for the Calculations subtest,
more family transitions was related to reduced pattern of performance.

**Family Poverty Variability (income-to-needs variability).** Models
unpacking the effect of family poverty variability on WJ overall and
subtest performance yielded surprising results. Specifically, the
directions of all effects were opposite to analyses using family poverty
average scores. For subtests that showed reduced performance at high
*mean* levels of family poverty, we found enhanced performance at high
levels of *variability* in family poverty. We believe such effects are
driven by the fact that family poverty mean and variability scores are
strongly negatively related (see Table 2), which has been reported
before elsewhere (Li et al., 2018). That is, families experiencing more
poverty tended to experience less income-to-needs variability. Put
differently, richer families were more likely to experience income
fluctuations.

This raises questions about using income-to-needs variability as an
indicator of unpredictability. In most empirical cases, higher levels of
harshness are associated with higher levels of unpredictability. One
possibility is that it matters how variability scores are computed over
repeated measures of income. Thus, to unpack this issue, we conducted a
set of secondary analyses that use different methods for computing
variability over income-to-needs scores. We report analyses using
different methods for quantifying variability in our Secondary Analyses
(see <https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-update1> for the update to our
analysis plan).

**Neighborhood Poverty Variability**. In contrast to family poverty
variability, more neighborhood poverty variability was related to higher
average neighborhood poverty. That is, families living in poor
neighborhoods (more harsh) were more likely to experience variability in
neighborhood poverty (unpredictability) from one to 54 months.
Additionally, the associations between average and variability scores
were moderate rather than strong (see Table 2).

There was no main effect of neighborhood poverty variability on overall
WJ scores (see Figure 4). There was only one significant interaction
with subtest performance. High neighborhood poverty variability was
associated with higher Audio-Visual Associations performance compared to
overall performance. However, this effect was inside the ROPE,
suggesting it was not meaningfully different from the overall effect. In
addition, simple effects showed that high neighborhood poverty
variability was not associated with performance on any subtest and all
simple effects were inside the ROPE.

Based on our inferential criteria, high neighborhood poverty variability
was associated with intact performance for overall and individual
subtest performance.

transitions and neighborhood poverty variability on WJ performance. The
top and bottom rows reflect family transitions and neighbhorhood poverty
variability, respectivly. The left column plots the overall slope (thick
black lines) against the subtest slopes across low to high
unpredictability. Unfaded and faded lines are practically inequivalent
and equivalent to the overall slope, respectivly. The middle and right

the main effect and zero for interactions and simple effects,
respectively. The gray ribbon reflects the ROPE. Solid points indicate
interactions and simple effects that are practically equivalent to the
ROPE. Hollow points reflect interaction and simple effects that are
outside the ROPE. Statistical significance for interactions (tested

## Secondary Analyses

Our primary analyses examining family poverty variability raised
questions about its validity as an unpredictability measure. Our
secondary analyses were designed to address this issue and explore
different methods of computing variability scores (see
<https://tinyurl.com/seccyd-wj-update1> for the secondary analysis
plan).

We computed three types of variability scores over the income-to-needs
data. The first was identical to our primary analyses; we computed a
simple within-person standard deviation of income-to-needs from 1 to 54
months. Second, we computed residual standard deviations (Li et al.,
2018). To do so, we fit a linear slope to each participant’s
income-to-needs data, extracted residual scores, and computed the
standard deviation of these residuals.

The last method computed percent change scores over each participant’s
income-to-needs data. In time series analysis, percent change reflects
how much a score changes relative to the previous time point. For
example, if one’s income is \\1,000 at time point 1 and increases to
\\1,500 at time point 2, their percent change score would be .50 or 50%
(\\500 increase is half of income at timepoint 1). The percent change
score is always relative to the previous timepoint so if income
increases another \\500 at timepoint 3, the percent change score would
be .33 or 33% (\\500 is 1/3 of timepoint 2 income of \\1500). After
computing percent change scores for each assessment, we averaged percent
change scores to create a single percent change score per participant.

Simple and residual standard deviation family poverty scores were
strongly related to both each other and to the average family poverty
(see Table 3). However, average percent change scores were only weakly
related to simple and residual standard deviation scores. In addition,
average percent change scores were weakly and negatively related to
family poverty average scores (see Table 3). That is, families
experiencing higher poverty also experienced larger average percent
changes over time. This is interesting for two reasons. First, at least
empirically, prior research would expect harsher environments to also be
more unpredictable (Belsky et al., 2012; Brumbach et al., 2009; Ellis et
al., 2009; Simpson et al., 2012; Szepsenwol et al., 2015). For other
indicators of unpredictability in the current work, this is the case.
Second, families experiencing higher poverty have less income. This
means smaller changes in income have a larger impact: a family with a
monthly income \\1,500 that loses \\500 the next month is impacted far
more than a family that earns \\5,000.

After computing each type of family poverty variability scores, we ran
three analyses with each as the primary predictor. We used the same
modeling strategy, covariates, and inferential criteria as our primary
analyses. Findings revealed similar patterns for both simple and
residual standard deviation scores: more variability in family poverty
was associated with enhanced performance, in contrast to the negative
associations with average family poverty (see Figure 5). Again, we
believe this is an artifact of the relation between family poverty
average and variability scores.

In contrast, however, average family percent change scores did not
follow this pattern. Instead, higher percent changes were consistent
with intact overall WJ test performance. The only subtest that differed
from the overall effect was the Calculations subtest, which showed that
higher percent changes was associated with a significant, but not
meaningful, reduction in performance. Simple effects showed higher
percent changes were associated with intact performance for all subtests
except the Auditory Processing subtest, which was meaningfully more
positive but not statistically different from zero.

<!--# Do you think this is a meaningful effect? The paragraph above Table 3 seems to conclude that this measure is behaving in unexpected ways, so I'm wondering how much we should read into these patterns of intact performance (over and above the fact that it is a secondary analysis. -->

![***Figure 5.*** Results of models testing the effect of different
family poverty varibility scores on WJ performance. The top, middle, and
bottom rows reflect simple standard deviation, residual standard
deviation, and average percent change in family poverty from one to 54
months. The left column plots the overall slope (thick black lines)
against the subtest slopes across low to high variation in family
poverty Unfaded and faded lines are practically inequivalent and
equivalent to the overall slope, respectivly. The middle and right
columns shows interaction and simple effects. Black horizontal lines are
the main effect and zero for interactions and simple effects,
respectively. The gray ribbon reflects the ROPE. Solid points indicate
interactions and simple effects that are practically equivalent to the
ROPE. Hollow points reflect interaction and simple effects that are
outside the ROPE. Statistical significance for interactions (tested
against the main effect) and simple effects (tested against zero) are
flagged with significance stars.
