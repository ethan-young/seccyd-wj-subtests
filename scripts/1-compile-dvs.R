# Setup -------------------------------------------------------------------
## Libraries ----
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(sjlabelled)

## Load Functions ----
source("scripts/0-create_codebook.R")
source("scripts/0-corr_table.R")

# Gather Woodcock Johnson data -------------------------------------------------------------
## Compile file names ----
seccyd_wj_files <- 
  list.files(path = "..", recursive = T, full.names = T) %>% 
  str_subset("Woodcock.*sav$")

seccyd_wj_years <-
  seccyd_wj_files %>%

  map(function(x) paste(x[3], x[2], sep = "_")) %>% 
  unlist %>% 
  str_remove("(st|rd|th)$") %>% 
  tolower()

## Create data list ----
seccyd_dvs_wj_list <- 
  map(seccyd_wj_files, function(x){
    
    data <- read_sav(x)
    codebook <- create_codebook(data)
    
    list(
      data = data,
      codebook = codebook
    )
  }) %>% 
  set_names(seccyd_wj_years)

## Compile standard scores ----
seccyd_dvs_wj_data1 <- 
  map2(names(seccyd_dvs_wj_list), seccyd_dvs_wj_list, function(x,y){
    assessment <- x %>%
      str_split("_") %>%

      unlist %>% 
      str_replace_all(c("year" = "y", "grade" = "g", "month" = "m"))
    
    y[[1]] %>% 
      select(ID, matches("_SS$")) %>%

    wj_lwid  = "Letter-Word Identification standard score. The first five items measure the ability to match a pictograph of a word with an actual picture. The remaining items measure reading identification skill in identifying isolated letters and words. Higher scores = more verbal knowledge.",

    wj_calc  = "Calculations standard score.  Measures mathematical calculation performance. Calcuations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and combinations of eaach. It also includes geometric, trigonometric, logarithmic, and calculus operations. Higher scores mean higher math calculation performance."

# Save data objects -------------------------------------------------------
## All data steps
save(
  seccyd_dvs_wj_list,
  seccyd_dvs_wj_data1, 
  seccyd_dvs_wj_data2, 
  file = "data/seccyd-dvs-wj.Rdata"
)

## Just the DVs wrangled above
write_csv(seccyd_dvs_wj_data2 |> create_codebook(), "codebooks/seccyd-dvs-wj.csv")
