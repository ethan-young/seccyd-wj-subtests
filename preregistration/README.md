### Q3: Research Questions

<i>\*Note that some research questions/hypotheses use causal language.
Although we are most interested in these causal questions, the data are
observational. We retain the causal language here but will use
non-causal language when relating any statistical test to these
questions/hypotheses.</i>

**R1:** How does adversity relate to overall performance compared to
subtest performance on large cognitive test batteries? In other words,
how does adversity relate to broad testing scores compared with more
narrow subtest scores?

**R2:** How do impairment and enhancements in cognitive performance
manifest across many cognitive domains?

**R3:** Do different adversity dimensions have similar or different
patterns of effects across broad and narrow cognitive performance
measures?

**R4:** Are the effects of adversity test-specific or test-general?

(Not sure that I want to keep R4 yet)

### Q4: Hypotheses

**H1:** We expect harshness and/or unpredictability to be associated
with a lower overall within-person Woodcock Johnson (WJ) cognitive
ability score (sum coded within-person intercept) .

**H2:** Compared with overall WJ scores, the effect of harshness and/or
unpredictability will vary; some sub-tests will show lowered performance
whereas others remain ‘intact’.

**H3:** If any sub-tests remain intact (or enhanced), they will be tests
that depend less on formal crystallized knowledge and reading ability
(i.e., short term memory, auditory processing, fluid intelligence).

## Part 2 - Data Description

### Q5: Dataset

We will use data from the National Institute of Child Health and
Development (NICHD) Study of Early Childcare and Youth Development
([SECCYD](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/series/00233), [Network,
2005](#ref-nichdearlychildcareresearchnetwork2005)). The SECCYD was
conducted in four waves across multiple sites and designed to be
nationally representative, prospective, longitudinal study. The broad
research goals of the study was to investigate the relation between
childcare and development from infancy through adolescence and into
early adulthood. Families were recruited for the NICHD SECCYD in 1991. A
total of 1364 families met all the prescreening criteria. Below are
detailed descriptions of each study phase:

## Part 3 - Variables

### Q11: Manipulated Variables:

**Not applicable**

### Q12: Measured Variables

#### Covariates

- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Maternal education
  - 1 = less than high school
  - 2 = high school or general education diploma
  - 3 = some college or vocational degree
  - 4 = college degree
  - 5 = some graduate school or master’s degree
  - 6 = graduate degree greater than a master’s degree

#### Independent Variables

Unpredictability

- Residential changes
- Parental transitions
- Job changes

Harshness

- Income-to-needs ratio
  - Total family income relative to the federal poverty line adjusted
    for family size

Exploratory variables:

- Maternal depression
- Variability in maternal depression
- Variability in income-to-needs
- Neighborhood income (1990 US Census)

#### Dependent Variables

The main dependent measures will come from the Woodcock-Johnson
Cognitive and Achievement Tests ([Woodcock, 1990](#ref-woodcock1990);
[Woodcock et al., 1990](#ref-woodcock1990a)).

![](../figures/table1.jpeg)

**Scores**

For all tests, we will use standard scores. These scores are equivalent
to IQ scores in that they use a mean of 100 and standard deviation of
15. This is useful when comparing many different tests.

**Aggregation strategy**

For each subtest, standard scores will be averaged over time to arrive
at one score per subtest. For example, picture vocabulary was measured
five times so overall picture vocabulary will be averaged over the five
time points.

### Q13: Inclusion/Exclusion criteria

At the time of writing this preregistration, the only inclusion criteria
are that participants should have a least one non-missing score on each
subtest for at least one measurment period. This ensures that every case
has at least one assessment of each subtest included in their overall
average of all subtests. Participants must also have at least one score
for the adversity measure. Each adversity measure will be analyzed in a
separate model so the total samples size for each adversity measure may
differ depending on missing data patterns (see Q14).

If it becomes clear that there are other inclusion/exclusion criteria,
we will update the preregistration and/or report deviations in the the
final manuscript. If there are many reasonable alternative criteria, we
may use multiverse analysis to handle all combinations of reasonable and
arbitrary inclusion/exclusion criteria.

### Q14: Missing data

## Part 4 - Knowledge of Data

### Q17: Relevant Publications

**No author has analyzed or worked with the Woodcock Johnson subtest
scores prior to this preregistration.**

EY has not published any papers using this dataset. In 2014 and 2015,
EY, JS, and GI submitted a paper to *Child Development* (rejected) and
*Development and Psychopathology* (withdrawn). The paper used aggregated
Woodcock Johnson scores over each assessment and used income-to-needs as
a covariate.

MN has intimate knowledge of this dataset. MN has published two papers
using the dataset, although MN has not analyzed or used the variables in
the current preregistration.

GI has intimate knowledge of this dataset. GI is a co-principle
investigator on the project and has published many papers using the
data. Variables analyzed in GI publications relate mostly to the
dependent variables in this project. Those relevant to the current
preregistration include:

- Bleil et al. ([2021](#ref-bleil2021))
- Cottrell et al. ([2015](#ref-cottrell2015))
- Monti et al. ([2014](#ref-monti2014))
- Fraley et al. ([2013](#ref-fraley2013))
- Roisman et al. ([2012](#ref-roisman2012))
- Burt & Roisman ([2010](#ref-burt2010))

JS has also worked with the current dataset. Variables in JS
publications relate mostly to the independent variables used in this
study. Those relevant to the current preregistration include:

- Hartman et al. ([2018](#ref-hartman2018a))
- Sung et al. ([2016](#ref-sung2016))

SV and WF have no prior experience with the data.

### Q18: Prior Knowledge

From prior work, we have some knowledge of how income, maternal
education, and quality of maternal caregiving (observations of maternal
sensitivity) are associated with aggregated Woodcock Johnson scores. For
example, Fraley et al. ([2013](#ref-fraley2013)) find correlations
between Woodcock Johnson composites over 5 assessment periods and
income-to-needs (averaged over 6, 15, 24, and 36 months; *rs* range =
.34-.37), maternal education (*rs* range = .41 - .47), and maternal
sensitivity (*rs* range = .40 - .47) . These findings give us a strong
prior that harshness/poverty will be associated with a lower within
person average Woodcock Johnson score.

## Part 5 - Analyses

### Q19: Hypotheses -\> Statistical Tests

Below is a conceptual depiction of our analyses:

<div id="fig-conceptual">

![](../figures/figure1.png)

Figure 1: We are interested in the effect of each adversity measure on a
person’s overall score, measured as a formative average of each subtest.
(A) is the main effect of adversity on overall performance. (B) is the
main effect of a subtest. (C) is the simple effect (slope) of adversity
for a particular subtest. (D) is the interaction effect that measures
the difference between A and C. A significant simple slope means the C ≠
0 and a significant interaction means A ≠ C. So, when C is significant,
it means that adversity affects performance. When D is significant, it
means that adversity affects a subtest in a different way than A
(overall pattern).

</div>

We will use a mixed effects linear regression to test Hypotheses 1 & 2
using the `lmer`. To do so, we proceed in three steps:

1.  We will standardize (z-score) our independent variables. This
    centers the IV at 0 and scales them with standard deviation = 1.

``` r
example_data1 <- 
  seccyd_dvs_wj_data2 |> 
  group_by(id) |> 
  summarize(
    # Average scores over time to single scores for each subtest
    across(starts_with("wj_"), list(mean = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = T), n = ~sum(!is.na(.x))))
  ) |> 
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ifelse(is.nan(.x), NA, .x))) |> 
  select(id, ends_with("mean")) |> 
  mutate(
    id = 1:n(),
    # Make up an adversity variable for the preregistration and standardize (step 1)
    adversity = rnorm(n()) |> scale() |> as.numeric()
  )
```

2.  We then stack the data into ‘long’ format. There are 10 subtests, so
    each participant will have 10 associated rows. Two new columns are
    created, one indicating the subtest type and one indicating each
    participant’s associated score.

Below is an example of one participant’s data:

``` r
example_data2 <- 
  example_data1 |> 
  # Stack data so that eadh participant has one row per subtest score (step 2)
  pivot_longer(c(-id, -adversity), names_to = "wj_sub_test", values_to = "score")

# Show an example of one participants data structure
example_data2 |> 
  filter(id == 1) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

|  id |  adversity | wj_sub_test   |    score |
|----:|-----------:|:--------------|---------:|
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_picvo_mean | 108.7500 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_vrba_mean  | 139.5000 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_pscmp_mean | 133.0000 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_appld_mean | 130.5000 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_memse_mean | 115.0000 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_incom_mean | 128.0000 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_memna_mean | 117.0000 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_lwid_mean  | 138.6667 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_wrdat_mean | 134.0000 |
|   1 | -0.9736841 | wj_calc_mean  | 143.0000 |

3.  Next, we apply a sum coded contrast to the subtest index column.
    This means the intercept in the mixed effect model reflects the
    grand mean of all WJ subtest scores. Sum coding allows us to compare
    the effect of adversity on each subtest to the mean of all tests.

For example, the underlying contrasts would look like the following:

``` r
example_data3 <- 
  example_data2 |> 
  mutate(
    # Apply sum contrasts (step 3)
    wj_sub_test = faux::contr_code_sum(wj_sub_test)
  )

# Show the contrast scheme for the mixed model
example_data3 |> 
  pull(wj_sub_test) |> 
  attr("contrasts") |> 
  as.data.frame() |> 
  rownames_to_column(var = "test") |> 
  mutate(
    test = str_replace_all(test,"^wj_(.*)_mean$", "\\1")
  ) |> 
  rename_with(
    .cols = everything(), 
    ~str_replace_all(.x ,"^.wj_(.*)_mean-intercept", "\\1")
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

| wrdat |    -1 |   -1 |    -1 |   -1 |    -1 |    -1 |    -1 |    -1 |   -1 |

4.  We fit a linear mixed effects model with the following terms
    - contrast coded subtest
    - adversity (standardized)
    - interaction between contrast coded subtest and adversity
    - random intercept for participants

``` r
# Fit model
subtest_model <- lmer(score ~ wj_sub_test * adversity + (1|id), data = example_data3)
```

Below is an example of the output from the above analysis:

### Q22: Inferential Criteria

Our inferential criteria will use p \< .05 for interaction effects
between adversity and subtest type and simple effects of adversity for
each subtest.

We interested in three effect sizes:

1.  The main effect of each adversity measure (tested in separate
    models).
2.  The simple effect of adversity for each subtest.
3.  The interaction effect between an adversity measure and subtest.

We are also interested in null effects. Based on prior work, we expect
the main effect of adversity to be negative. However, if main effects
were zero for any adversity measure, we would be interested in
determining if the effect *is* zero by using equivalence testing
([Lakens et al., 2018](#ref-lakens2018)).

For simple effects (effect size 2), we will use simple slopes analysis.
These tests determine whether the simple effect is different from zero.
For these effects, we are interested if they are indeed 0, possibly
using equivalence testing. We are also interested positive slopes of any
size (that are not equivalent to zero).

For negative slopes, we are interested in effects that are different
from the overall main effect of adversity. This is where the interaction
term is important. The interaction effect tests whether the effect of
adversity for a given subtest is different from the main effect of
adversity on overall performance. We are interested in both more
negative and more positive than expected slopes compared to the main
effect.

### Q23: Assumption Violations

If any assumptions are violated, we will update the preregistration
and/or report deviations from the preregistration. However, we do not
anticipate any serious violations.

### Q24: Evaluating Strength, Reliability, and Robustness

If there are arbitrary data processing decisions, we may use multiverse
analysis to systematically explore their effect.

### Q25: Exploratory Analyses

We may or may not do serveral exploratory analyses listed below:

1.  Fit structural equation models to Woodcock Johnson data to examine
    how adversity relates to an overall latent variable and to residual
    test variance in each subtest
2.  Depending on the main results, we may also look at subtest scores
    over time to examine developmental trajectories in those tests.
3.  We may run additional analyses identical to our main analyses but
    with different adversity measures that are not central to our
    framework.

## Part 6 - Statement of Integrity

The authors of this preregistration state that they filled out this
preregistration to the best of their knowledge and that no other
preregistration exists pertaining to the same hypotheses and dataset.
