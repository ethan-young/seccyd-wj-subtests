### Q3: Research Questions

<i>*Note that some research questions/hypotheses use causal language. Although we are most interested in these causal questions, the data are observational. We retain the causal language here but will use non-causal language when relating any statistical test to these questions/hypotheses.</i>

**R1:** How does adversity relate to overall performance compared to subtest performance on large cognitive test batteries? In other words, how does adversity relate to broad testing scores compared with more narrow subtest scores?

**R2:** How do impairment and enhancements in cognitive performance manifest across many cognitive domains?

**R3:** Do different adversity dimensions have similar or different patterns of effects across broad and narrow cognitive performance measures?

**R4:** Are the effects of adversity test-specific or test-general?

(Not sure that I want to keep R4 yet)

### Q4: Hypotheses

**H1:** We expect harshness and/or unpredictability to be associated with a lower overall within-person Woodcock Johnson (WJ) cognitive ability score (sum coded within-person intercept) .

**H2:** Compared with overall WJ scores, the effect of harshness and/or unpredictability will vary; some sub-tests will show lowered performance whereas others remain 'intact'. 

**H3:** If any sub-tests remain intact (or enhanced), they will be tests that depend less on formal crystallized knowledge and reading ability (i.e., short term memory, auditory processing, fluid intelligence).

## Part 2 - Data Description

### Q5: Dataset

We will use data from the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD) Study of Early Childcare and Youth Development [[SECCYD](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/series/00233), @nichdearlychildcareresearchnetwork2005]. The SECCYD was conducted in four waves across multiple sites and designed to be nationally representative, prospective, longitudinal study. The broad research goals of the study was to  investigate the relation between childcare and development from infancy through adolescence and into early adulthood. Families were recruited for the NICHD SECCYD in 1991. A total of 1364 families met all the prescreening criteria. Below are detailed descriptions of each study phase:

- [Phase 1 (1991-1994)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/21940)

## Part 3 - Variables

### Q11: Manipulated Variables:

*NA*

### Q12: Measured Variables

#### Covariates

- Gender
- Ethnicity

#### Independent Variables

Unpredictability

- Residential changes
- Parental transitions
- Job changes

Harshness

- Income-to-needs ratio

#### Dependent Variables

The main dependent measures will come from the Woodcock-Johnson Cognitive and Achievement Tests [@woodcock1990; @woodcock1990a].

![](../figures/table1.jpeg)

##### Scores

For all tests, we will use standard scores. These scores are equivalent to IQ scores in that they use a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. This is useful when comparing many different tests.

##### Aggregation strategy

For each subtest, standard scores will be averaged over time to arrive at one score per subtest. For example, picture vocabulary was measured five times so overall picture vocabulary will be averaged over the five time points.

### Q19: Hypotheses -> Statistical Tests

Below is a conceptual depiction of our analyses:


:::{#fig-conceptual}

![](../figures/figure1.png)

We are interested in the effect of each adversity measure on a person’s overall score, measured as a formative average of each subtest. (A) is the main effect of adversity on overall performance. (B) is the main effect of a subtest. (C) is the simple effect (slope) of adversity for a particular subtest. (D) is the interaction effect that measures the difference between A and C. A significant simple slope means the C ≠ 0 and a significant interaction means A ≠ C. So, when C is significant, it means that adversity affects performance. When D is significant, it means that adversity affects a subtest in a different way than A (overall pattern).
:::


We will use a mixed effects linear regression to test Hypotheses 1 & 2 using the `lmer`. To do so, we proceed in three steps:

1. We will standardize (z-score) our independent variables. This centers the IV at 0 and scales them with standard deviation = 1.

```{r}
example_data1 <- 
  seccyd_dvs_wj_data2 |> 
  group_by(id) |> 
  summarize(
    # Average scores over time to single scores for each subtest
    across(starts_with("wj_"), list(mean = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = T), n = ~sum(!is.na(.x))))
  ) |> 
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ifelse(is.nan(.x), NA, .x))) |> 
  select(id, ends_with("mean")) |> 
  mutate(
    id = 1:n(),
    # Make up an adversity variable for the preregistration and standardize (step 1)
    adversity = rnorm(n()) |> scale() |> as.numeric()
  )
```

2. We then stack the data into 'long' format. There are 10 subtests, so each participant will have 10 associated rows. Two new columns are created, one indicating the subtest type and one indicating each participant's associated score. 

Below is an example of one participant's data:

```{r data-structure}
example_data2 <- 
  example_data1 |> 
  # Stack data so that eadh participant has one row per subtest score (step 2)
  pivot_longer(c(-id, -adversity), names_to = "wj_sub_test", values_to = "score")

# Show an example of one participants data structure
example_data2 |> 
  filter(id == 1) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

3. Next, we apply a sum coded contrast to the subtest index column. This means the intercept in the mixed effect model reflects the grand mean of all WJ subtest scores. Sum coding allows us to compare the effect of adversity on each subtest to the mean of all tests. 

For example, the underlying contrasts would look like the following:

```{r sum-coding}
example_data3 <- 
  example_data2 |> 
  mutate(
    # Apply sum contrasts (step 3)
    wj_sub_test = faux::contr_code_sum(wj_sub_test)
  )

# Show the contrast scheme for the mixed model
example_data3 |> 
  pull(wj_sub_test) |> 
  attr("contrasts") |> 
  as.data.frame() |> 
  rownames_to_column(var = "test") |> 
  mutate(
    test = str_replace_all(test,"^wj_(.*)_mean$", "\\1")
  ) |> 
  rename_with(
    .cols = everything(), 
    ~str_replace_all(.x ,"^.wj_(.*)_mean-intercept", "\\1")
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

4. We fit a linear mixed effects model with the following terms
    - contrast coded subtest 
    - adversity (standardized)
    - interaction between contrast coded subtest and adversity
    - random intercept for participants

```{r model, echo=TRUE}
# Fit model
subtest_model <- lmer(score ~ wj_sub_test * adversity + (1|id), data = example_data3)
```

Below is an example of the output from the above analysis:

**Unstandardized Parameters**

```{r unstd, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
# Standardized and Unstandardized parameters
subtest_model |> 
  parameters::parameters() |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.x, 3))) |> 
  mutate(
    Parameter = str_replace_all(Parameter, "^wj_sub_test.wj_(.*)_mean-intercept","\\1"),
    Parameter = str_replace(Parameter, ":", " * ")
  ) |> 
  filter(Effects == "fixed") |> 
  select(Parameter, Coefficient, SE, p) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

**Standardized Parameters**

```{r std, echo=TRUE}
# Standardized and Unstandardized parameters
subtest_model |> 
  parameters::standardize_parameters() |>
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(.x, 3))) |> 
  mutate(
    Parameter = str_replace_all(Parameter, "^wj_sub_test.wj_(.*)_mean-intercept","\\1"),
    Parameter = str_replace(Parameter, ":", " * ")
  ) |> 
  select(-CI) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```
