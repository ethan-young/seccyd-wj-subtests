### Q3: Research Questions

**R1:** How does adversity relate to overall cognitive performance compared to component-level performance?

**R2:** Do different adversity dimensions have similar or different patterns of effects?

**R3:** Are the effects of adversity task-specific or task-general?

### Q4: Hypotheses

**H1:** We expect harshness and/or unpredictability to be associated with a lower overall within-person Woodcock Johnson (WJ) cognitive ability score (sum coded within-person intercept) .

**H2:** Compared with overall WJ scores, the effect of harshness and/or unpredictability will vary; some sub-tests will show lowered performance whereas others remain 'intact'. 

**H3:** If any sub-tests remain intact, they will be tests that depend less on formal crystallized knowledge and reading ability (i.e., short term memory, auditory processing, fluid intelligence).

## Part 2 - Data Description

### Q5: Dataset

We will use data from the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD) Study of Early Childcare and Youth Development [[SECCYD](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/series/00233), @nichdearlychildcareresearchnetwork2005]. The SECCYD was conducted in four waves across multiple sites and designed to be nationally representative, prospective, longitudinal study. The broad research goals of the study was to  investigate the relation between childcare and development from infancy through adolescence and into early adulthood. Families were recruited for the NICHD SECCYD in 1991. A total of 1364 families met all the prescreening criteria. Below are detailed descriptions of each study phase:

- [Phase 1 (1991-1994)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/21940)
- [Phase 2 (1995-1999)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/21941)
- [Phase 3 (2000-2004)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/21942)
- [Phase 4 (2000-2004)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/22361)

### Q6: Public Availability -

Data are publicly available. However, users must make an account with ISCPR (see [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/rpxlogin)) abd must sign a data use agreement. Users must also provide details about how data will be used (e.g., project description) and information (e.g., IRB approval). For each study phase, see more information about data access under "Access Restricted Data" tab.

#### H1 & H2

We will use a mixed effects linear regression to test Hypotheses 1 & 2 using the `lmer`. To do so, we proceed in three steps:

1. We will standardize (z-score) our independent variables. This centers the IV at 0 and scales them with standard deviation = 1.
2. We then stack the data into 'long' format. There are 10 subtests, so each participant will have 10 associated rows. Two new columns are created, one indicating the subtest type and one indicating each participant's associated score.
3. Next, we apply a sum coded contrast to the subtest index column. This means the intercept in the mixed effect model reflects the grand mean of WJ subtest scores. Sum coding allows us to compare the effect of adversity on each subtest to the mean of all tests.
4. We fit a linear mixed effects model with the following terms
    - contrast coded subtest 
    - adversity (standardized)
    - interaction between contrast coded subtest and adversity
    - random intercept for participants

Below is code that implements this analysis pipeline:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Prepare data
data_long <-
  data_wide  |> 
  # Standardize IVs 
  mutate(adversity_z = scale(adversity) |> as.numeric()) |> 
  # Long format
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wj_"), names_to = "wj_sub_test", values_to = "score") |> 
  # Contrast for comparison to grand mean
  mutate(wj_sub_test_contr = contr_code_sum(wj_sub_test, omit = "appl"))

# Fit model
subtest_model <- lmer(score ~ wj_subtest * adversity + (1|id), data = data_long)
```
